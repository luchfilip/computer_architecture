###1. Von Neumann architecture.  Computer components.

Virtually all contemporary computers are based on concepts developed by John von Neumann.
Such design is based on 3 concepts:

1. data and instructions are stored in a single read-write memory;
2. the contents of this memory are addressable by locations without regard to the type
of data contained there;
3. Execution occurs in a sequential way from one instruction to the next.

This is the basic for von Neumann architecture. According to it the computer consists
of:
* CPU(Central Processing Unit);
  * Control unit;
  * AU (Arithmetic and logic unit);
  * Registers.
* Main memory;
* I/O system.

CPU and Main Memory forms a central unit.
A central unit, I/O system and a set of system programs forms a Computer.
A computer and a peripheral devices forms a computer system or a microcomputer system(if
CPU represents a microprocessor).
